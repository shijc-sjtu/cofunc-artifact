chcore_config(CHCORE_DRIVER_FWK_CIRCLE BOOL OFF "Build Circle driver framework?")

#[[
The following configs are common to all architectures and platforms, while
different architectures and platforms may build different implementations
of these drivers. For example, on Raspberry Pi platform, Circle framework
is used for CHCORE_DRIVER_ETHERNET, while a dedicated hdmi driver is used
for CHCORE_DRIVER_HDMI.

So the following configs can be viewed as "whether to enable the feature",
while which driver implementation to use is controlled by the CMakeLists of
each architecture or platform.
